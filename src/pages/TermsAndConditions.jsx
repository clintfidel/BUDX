        <p>
            BEVZ is an online e-commerce platform that enables consumers (“you/your” or “yourself”) to 
            purchase alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages (the “Products”) that are sold by licensed 
            third party retailers (the “Retailers”) and have the Products delivered to you by third party 
            delivery partners (the “Delivery Partners”).
        </p>
        <p>
            All returns and/or refunds of Products shall be governed by this refund and returns policy 
            (the “Refund Policy”).
        </p>
        <p>
            You must initiate a return of the Products with BEVZ customer care within 48 hours after 
            delivery of the Products to your nominated delivery address by a Delivery Partner.
        </p>
        <p>
            A photograph or picture evidence of the Products that you wish to return must please be 
            submitted to BEVZ customer care in order for us to validate the return. We reserve the right 
            to reject a return in the absence of a photograph or picture evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            When returning Products, you must ensure that all seals, tags and accessories are left intact 
            and the Products are in its original packaging. If you have broken the seal of the Products or 
            otherwise opened or consumed the Products that you wish to return, your return will be invalid 
            and you will not be eligible to receive a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to return a Product because you have received a wrong, damaged, defective or 
            counterfeit Product, the Retailers will be responsible for the costs associated with returning 
            the Products, provided that you have submitted a photograph or picture evidence as contemplated 
            above and we have validated your return for the reasons stated by you.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to return a Product due to a change of mind, you will be responsible for the 
            reasonable direct costs of having the Products returned and restored into a saleable condition 
            after it has already been delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a return has been validated and approved by us and the Retailers, if applicable, such 
            return will be completed through collection by the Delivery Partner who will return the Products 
            to the Retailers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you initiate a return in accordance with these provisions and the refund is approved by us, 
            we will use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the refund of any money paid by you 
            within 7 (seven) working days of the return.
